            <h1>The Best Movie</h1>
            <br />
            <p>
              The story begins as "Don" Vito Corleone, the head of a New York
              Mafia "family", oversees his daughter's wedding with his wife
              Carmela. His beloved son Michael has just come home from the war,
              but does not intend to become part of his father's business.
              Through Michael's life the nature of the family business becomes
              clear. The business of the family is just like the head of the
              family, kind and benevolent to those who give respect, but given
              to ruthless violence whenever anything stands against the good of
              the family. Don Vito lives his life in the way of the old country,
              but times are changing and some don't want to follow the old ways
              and look out for community and "family". An up and coming rival of
              the Corleone family wants to start selling drugs in New York, and
              needs the Don's influence to further his plan. The clash of the
              Don's fading old world values and the new ways will demand a
              terrible price, especially from Michael, all for the sake of the
              family.
